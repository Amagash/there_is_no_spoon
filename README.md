ðŸ¥„There is no spoon 
===========
There is no spoon is an application to generate adversarial images.

## Quick Start
To use the app:
- *pre-requisite*: You need to have docker installed. You can find the documentation 
here https://docs.docker.com/install/
- put the image you want to change in your current directory
- run the following command and change MY_IMAGE.PNG with the name of your image
```
 sudo docker pull amagash/there_is_no_spoon:latest
 sudo docker run -v $(pwd):/data amagash/there_is_no_spoon --input /data/MY_IMAGE.PNG
```
- the output image will be saved in your current directory under the name "adversarial_image.png"

## Advanced features
Several arguments can be passed to the docker to customize your adversarial image generation.

### Synopsis

     sudo docker run -v $(pwd):/data amagash/there_is_no_spoon --input /data/MY_IMAGE.PNG
     [--output=OUTPUT_PATH][--mode=MODE][--target_class=TARGET_CLASS][--target_score=TARGET_SCORE]
     [--learning_rate=LEARNING_RATE][--max_change=MAX_CHANGE]

### Flags
`--input=INPUT_PATH`\
This sets your file input path. By default it's the current directory.

`--output=OUTPUT_PATH`\
This sets your file destination output. By default it is the current directory.

`--mode=MODE`\
You can run the code in 2 modes: "predict" or "generate".
- The "predict" mode simply takes an image as an input and prints the classification of this image.
- The "generate" mode let's you generate an adversarial image from an input image of your choice.
By default, mode="generate".

`--target_class=TARGET_CLASS`\
The class index corresponding to the new object you would like to change your image to. For instance,
if you have a picture of a cat and you want to generate and adversarial image from the cat image 
that will be classified as being a spoon, you need to find the corresponding index for the
spoon classification. You can find the different class and their index here: 
https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/imagenet_class_index.json

By default, the target_class=910, corresponding to the 
classification of a wooden spoon (because there is no spoon ðŸ˜‰).

`--target_score=TARGET_SCORE`\
The target score is the minimum score  you would like to reach for 
the new classification (which should be between 0 and 1). For instance, if you have a picture of a cat and you
want to generate and adversarial image from the cat image that will be classified as being a spoon
with a confidence of at least 95%, you need to set your target_score to 0.95. By default, target_score = 0.98 to reach
at least 98% confidence for the new classification.

`--learning_rate=LEARNING_RATE`\
The learning rate corresponds to how much to update the adversarial image in each iteration.
Lower value will make your model more precise but might also slow the generation of the adversarial image. 
By default, learning_rate=0.5.

`--max_change=MAX_CHANGE`\
The maximum change each pixel can support. By default, max_change=0.1.
Larger number produces an image faster but risks more distortions.
